    <h1>Windsor, William</h1>
    <p>After years of effort, I am very sorry to have to write on the current state of the health of William Windsor, His Royal Highness(HRH) The Prince of Wales. We are finding
      , with Boem, that he is suffering from an ailment that has yet to be created within the Medical Community's vocabulary for diagnoses. This ailment is called Recognition Malnourishment.
      Caring about others with all that he has, he has given so much of himself to everyone that he is in a place of deathly malnourishment from the amount of recognition that he is getting.</p>
    <p>We do realise that he is in charge of the allocation of perhaps that many people's resources, which is why we are making this announcement.</p>
    <h2>Resource Allocation</h2>
    <p>For everyone to still get their resources from him, during this time, we are building a programme for this problem to be solved. Development is beginning today, 2025-09-07, yes,
    it will influence the development of other programmes such as this. This programme is looking to be a visualiser for Resource Allocation occurances and processes. There will be features
    for direct communication with the Prince of Wales, upon his recovery.</p>
    <p>Until HRH the Prince of Wales is recovered, all of his Resource Allocation Networks and those connected will need to be frozen during this development process. If you are in one
    of his resource networks, you will need to temporarily get resources elsewhere. His entire network has entered a phase of Hospice, until further notice.</p>
    <p>Examples of being in connections to his Resource Allocation Networks are Earthshot Prize employees, partners, patrons, affiliates, Royal Household Employees, Catherine Middleton,
    businesses funded by the Royal Family, or anyone that is gaining their resources from the British Royal Family.</p>
    <h2>Recognition Malnourishment</h2>
    <p>Recognition Malnourishment is a form of malnourishment that happens from the rate of recognition intensity that an individual goes through. The issue causing this form of
    malnourishment is behaviour from the experience of recognition of a known individual. This can begin to occur from a high level of popularity. When it begins to form is from
    the flow of people going into that person's vicinity, from a state or level of popularity, desire, or need, resulting in too much stimulation, causing a rate of burning nutrition
    greater than the ability to consume it.</p>
