        <h1>Sam Pegram</h1>
        <p>Sam Pegram was found surviving on a remote island, such as a sand bar, for 6 years, after abandoning a plane crash in 2019 into the ocean. 
            Because of the lack of Dark Accessibility, news about this crash has been 
            miscaptured. Intel on this incident included that it was believed to be 
            a crash landing on land, whereas it was in the ocean, having 
            then gathered remains on land at the Etheopian Capital 
            for investigation. The tragedy and consequence of this loss of 
            information caused Sam Pegram to survive on seaweed and aquatic 
            carcasses for over half a decade, completely in solidarity, alone. 
            Understood as a type of suicide attack, the plane crashed after gun shots 
            went off of hand in the flight crew cabin, leaving the passengers 
            in a panic. Covid, now recognised as N-Dodecane poisoning, such as that of 
            Lyme Disease, was accepted as the cause of the insanity and confusion, 
            moving us all to realise a greater responsibility for Electrical Using 
            Communities to move to softer power solutions, such as that of Solar Energy. 
            Sam will now be under Forest van Eeden's full-time care until further recovery,
            having suffered Government and care failures by the United Kingdom, after the 
            financial abuse from their intellectual theft of Forest van Eeden's gift and trust
             of Sam's survival location.

            Sam Pegram is being transitioned out of Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital at Barrack Rd, Exeter EX2 5DW, United Kingdom  
            and into Forest van Eeden's full-time care in Palm Coast, Florida, under Organic Preservation. Using Forest's previous 
            addresses, the United Kingdom has slowly and painfully drawn out Sam's "care" as means to draw more funding that 
            belongs to Forest van Eeden, for themselves. <br><br>
            With the advancement of technology, this will no longer be possible for them, Sam is simply in a state of escrow there. 
            What they have done is put Sam in William's place in hospice. This level of abuse has never been seen before and results 
            in William's lost welcome with Forest van Eeden.
