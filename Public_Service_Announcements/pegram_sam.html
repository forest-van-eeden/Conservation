        <h1>Sam Pegram</h1>
        <p>Sam Pegram was found surviving on a remote island, such as a sand bar, for 6 years, after abandoning a plane crash in 2019 into the ocean. 
            Because of the lack of Dark Accessibility, news about this crash has been 
            miscaptured. Intel on this incident included that it was believed to be 
            a crash landing on land, whereas it was in the ocean, having 
            then gathered remains on land at the Etheopian Capital 
            for investigation. The tragedy and consequence of this loss of 
            information caused Sam Pegram to survive on seaweed and aquatic 
            carcasses for over half a decade, completely in solidarity, alone. 
            Understood as a type of suicide attack, the plane crashed after gun shots 
            went off of hand in the flight crew cabin, leaving the passengers 
            in a panic. Covid, now recognised as N-Dodecane poisoning, such as that of 
            Lyme Disease, was accepted as the cause of the insanity and confusion, 
            moving us all to realise a greater responsibility for Electrical Using 
            Communities to move to softer power solutions, such as that of Solar Energy. 
            Sam will now be under Forest van Eeden's full-time care until further recovery,
            having suffered Government and care failures by the United Kingdom, after the 
            financial abuse from their intellectual theft of Forest van Eeden's gift and trust
             of Sam's survival location.
