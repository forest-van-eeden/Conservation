    <h2>Starting Rabies Outbreak</h2>
    <p>Today, November 4, 2025, is a day marking the discovery of an extremely severe global rabies outbreak. 
    Currently, rabies is in plant-based foods, most people, and most animals (including insects). While insects 
    do aid in detoxing rabies, they also carry other forms of contaminants, such as <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/nuclear/n-contamination.html">N-Contamination</a>.
    While N-Contamination is lethal in high doses or without means of detoxing the contamination, it does serve a purpose here. 
    The ability it has to provide Nuclear Cook, noted at the bottom of the linked Research Document, allows for its use to 
    cook rabies, existing in a living body. While this knowledge is helpful in order to feel calm and manage the amount of 
    N-Contamination within the body, it is not completely necessary, if insects are able to continue to share healing 
    with their blood drawing in the <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Conservation/Boem/conservation/natural_conservation/organic_conservation/organic_beholding/organic_preservation/organic_network/organic_network.html">Organic Network</a>.</p>
    <p>Several problems have caused this outbreak, one being a recent celestial body explosion. This explosion caused 
    an extreme charge to further N-Contamination into a global pandemic, known as Covid. Other causes include the following: 
    meat industrialisation, farming industrialisation, antibiotic misuse, nuclear warfare, excess nuclear electricity, and 
    the normalisation of meat diets. Further, we are uncertain of the extent of what cannibalism could have been taking 
    place, during these times of pandemonium.</p>
    <p>Cannibalism stems from the roots: "cannabis", "bal", and "ism". What that means, put together, is the demonisation of 
    the eating of Cannabis. This would then cause, in historical times, eating of dead bodies for Cannabis, from starvation (occassionally famine), 
    and then would form into outbreaks of Rabies. It is such form of Rabies, that we are seeing today in majority of the cases. 
    See my <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/carnivore/plant-based_taurine.html">Plant-Based Taurine</a> Research Document for more information.</p>
    <p>This rabies pandemic started in Early February of 2019. It is at the extent of generations of starvation from groomed survival on meat from meat. 
    This type of survival causes an experience such as a loss of conciousness at eating nutrition. This is where the common use of the word "rabid" comes from.</p>
    <h2>2025/11/25</h2>
    <p>A domestic-wildlife mouse was found dead with rabies near a home in the Matanzas Woodlands area of Palm Coast, Florida, USA at 
    approximately 11pm, after sprinting to go towards a clean area with Kosher Vegan Wildlife Resources.</p>
    <p>In the area of the mouse's recovered body, there is a heavy amount of Militarized Rabies in the air from men on Meat-Only diets, 
      expected to be a military regulation in place. Feelings such as "a desire to eat one's self" float around in the air as a 
    form of Rabies growth, causing panic and death in the wildlife populations, as well as risking the lives of domestic animals, 
    children, and people. It is at the extent of seeping through the pores of the local people's living skin at the height of the 
    amount of the Rabies.</p>
    <p>The mouse was found to have died from tumorous growth from the amount of rabies in her body during her detoxing effort.</p>
    <p>Several Bumblebees have been found over the past year requiring recovery from rabies amounts, a couple of King Male Bumblebees 
    having died, causing a failure in their crossbreeding. We can expect to see inbreeding from Bumblebee populations and the loss of 
    the Common Yellow Bumblebee from this rabies outbreak.</p>
