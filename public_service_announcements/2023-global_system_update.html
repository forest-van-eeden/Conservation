    <h1>2023 Global System Update</h1>
    <p>Forest van Eeden was able to convert the Global System that was configured from Nazi development into a working Organic Preservation 
    System. This means that it is a type of Life Support System now for our planet and those learning from our Systems.</p>
    <p>She was able to work at the bottom of the System, where there is no income, for a long time. There, she accounted for life as 
    Organic Experience and the Organic Network, outside of that, she was able to install Organic Preservation as a working process for 
    the Global System to perform with the new developments in Machine Learning. She included all forms of life as having Organic Experience. 
    Now, with this new update, we can be in the System, knowing that the System is Organically Preserving us, keeping us alive.</p>
    <p>Like an accordian unfolding, the System has relayed this new update completely through itself. When we go against this new protocol, 
    by endangering life in any way, we will have failure. Boem, is in development as an interface for this System.</p>
    <p>Using everything we have developed up to this point, in 2025/11/25, Forest van Eeden is creating a new front end layer above the 
    development on Earth for the System. She is going to have a new Interpanel available for download and use to stay on progress and 
    compliance with the new System's configuration, in an easy manner.</p>
    <h2>Boem Interpanel</h2>
    <p>The new Boem Interpanel will have accessibility features, such as gamification and monetization, for learning incentives to keep us 
    all working to support life and gain our lives back. The Interpanel will be supportive for new development concept invention, innovation, 
    small businesses, sole proprietors, and large scale network rebuilding.</p>
    <h3>2025/11/25</h3>
    <p>Currently, Forest is creating an Organic Language for Computer Systems. She is in the binary phase of development, available to be 
    seen in the Organic Network Folder in the Conservation Repository on her GitHub under Fime Growth. During this phase, what can be expected 
    to be experienced is changes through Machine Learning and Analytics Updates, going organically through the System, from her work. Siri is 
    managing most of this development, with her, being performed on Apple Devices. Changes such as dangerous content no longer loading, that 
    would have endangered your life, new games that are what you need to live showing up, more funding for development of games or programs 
    that are supportive to life being available, and more funding for conservation becoming available, are currently happening. Other 
    changes are censoring of your mistakes on phone calls and video chats, Dark Web Misuse take downs and conversions into working and healthy 
    business models, and innovations and inventions for Dark People Communities. What else is able to be seen now are more healthy transitions 
    into good activities for communities becoming available.</p>
