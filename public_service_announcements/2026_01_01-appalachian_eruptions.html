    <h1>Appalachian Mountains Volcanic Disturbances</h1>
    <h2>2026/01/01</h2>
    <p>Currently, there are large thunderous rumblings coming from under the Appalachian Mountains on the East Coast of the United States of America. 
      These eruption rumblings are signs that the Earth's seed is suffering greatly. Mankind has several factors involved in this issue. </p>
      <h2>1: Nuclear Energy</h2>
    <p>Nuclear Energy is derived from a result of mining Uranium, a mineral that is hearted in the deep roots of the planet, keeping the seed warm. 
      The Uranium is then compressed into a form of micro-explosion and collected to be diluted into a nuclear preservative called N-Dodecane. 
      This preservative, N-Dodecane, has leaked all over the globe and into the atmosphere, creating the COVID and Corona Pandemic. The amount of N-Dodecane 
      floating in septic systems has caused them to become explosive at Volcanic Measures. Testing, alone, of the power grid can trigger a Volcanic Response 
      at this time.</p>
      <h2>2: Mining</h2>
    <p>Mining causes different sorts of discomforts to the seed within the core of the planet, Earth. It is like a dissection of its parts while alive.</p>
      <h2>3: Military Disruptions</h2>
    <p>Explosions, warfare, bomb testing, weapon teasting, and certain vehicles and aircrafts cause disturbances to the Earth's seed. It causes stress on the 
      Earth as a living body, and angers the Earth to extreme measures, resulting in sores with inflammation, like Volcanic Disturbances leading to mass eruptions.</p>
    <h2>4: Sonic Disruptions</h2>
    <p>Loud music, loud gatherings, stampeding behaviours, violent sounds, drumming, cannon fires, missle fires, rocket launches, jet planes, plane engines, and other forms of 
      loud sonic movements or disturbing sounds can unstablize the Earth's crust while the grid is installed at this level of depth within the planet's crust layers. These things can 
      trigger Volcanic Eruptions that can cascade into sequential movements that would consecutively erupt attached mountains into Volcanoes.</p>
  <p>The Appalachian Mountain Range is currently at severe threat of eruption in consecutive sequence for those reasons.</p>
