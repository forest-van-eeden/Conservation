    <h1>Current Shellfish Poisoning Outbreak</h1>
    <p>What seems to be an issue stemming from incorporation of shellfish in the water supplies for natural forms of Manganese 
    depositing, is now resulting in Shellfish Poisoning Outbreaks. Products, City Waters, and other filtered waters have now 
    been contaminated with Shellfish Remains.</p>
    <p>If you are suffering from this condition or outbreak, please refer to the <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/carnivore/cancer.html">Cancer Research Discovery Document</a> 
    for learning about new detoxing methods that are working.</p>
