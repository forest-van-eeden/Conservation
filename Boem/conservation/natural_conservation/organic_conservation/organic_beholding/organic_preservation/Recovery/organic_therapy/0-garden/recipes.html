    <h2>Vegetable Pot Pie</h2>
    <p class="recipe">This is a light recipe for vegetable pot pie. Completely plant-based, we begin with mixing the filling. 
      What has been found to be the best style baking dish for this is a small single tupper-ware style pyrex left-over dish. 
      Larger glass dishes or whatever baking tin is available will work as well, where bread could be made inside. <br><br>
      Heating the oven at 331F, or medium heat for any other form of oven, will be where this dish is cooked. The filling is to 
      be mixed in a small bowl that has a fork for whisking along. <u>Plant Milks</u> are to be used in these dishes, it is up to you 
      which one fits your needs. <br><br>
      Beginning with what vegetables go inside, we start with sprinkling some <u>Frozen Spinach Bits</u> in our bowl. The goal here is to 
      make this dish feel and be real food available, in a lighter form for sensitivities. <u>Peas</u> in a small amount and <u>Corn</u> are 
      then added from preserves, cans, or the freezer, into your mixing bowl. From there, we sprinkle some <u>Potato Flakes</u>, making certain 
      they are free of butter or milk, when purchased at the store. Potato Flakes are used for making mashed potatoes much of the time. A little 
      bit of <u>Potato Starch</u> is then added, with <u>Tumeric Spice</u> in a dashing amount. A <u>Generic Season All</u> will be the salt 
      and pepper for this dish, with a sprinkle of <u>Nutritional Yeast</u>. Pouring your amount of Plant Milk is then the next step, to make 
      it the gravy mixture that is needed. <u>Gnocchi</u> or <u>Potato Pieces</u> can also be added into the mixture. When whisking the mixture 
      with a fork, add in <u>Corn Starch</u> as needed for your desired thickness, remembering that you will put the dish to bake in the oven, so 
      the mixture will thicken in there. We will place the baking dish in the oven to toughen the mix before adding bread dough on top. But, first 
      make certain that you have added a spoon or so of <u>Vegetable Oil</u> into your mixture.<br><br>
      Pour the mixture into your baking dish, let it sit in the oven until you see or feel in you that it is time to pour what we will make 
      in the meantime, on top. The Dough goes as the top layer here. In the same bowl, using the remaining mixture as some added flavor, we 
      will add in some <u>Flour</u>, which can also be added into the mixture, if there is still a feeling of liquid needing addressing, but 
      in small amounts for that. For the bread top, we start with some Flour, a dip of <u>Baking Soda</u>, a sprinkle of <u>Yeast</u>, and some 
      spices for flavor, suggesting Sage. Add the amount of <u>Water</u> that is desired so that it is something like a pancake batter, take out 
      your Pie Mix from toughening in the oven, and pour the bread mix on top, smearing it evenly as a rising layer. Bake until the bread looks 
      toasted, and you have yourself a Vegetable Pot Pie.
