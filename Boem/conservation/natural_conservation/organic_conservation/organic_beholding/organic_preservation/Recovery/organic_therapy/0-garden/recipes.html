    <h2>Vegetable Pot Pie</h2>
    <p class="recipe">This is a light recipe for vegetable pot pie. Completely plant-based, we begin with mixing the filling. 
      What has been found to be the best style baking dish for this is a small single tupper-ware style pyrex left-over dish. 
      Larger glass dishes or whatever baking tin is available will work as well, where bread could be made inside. <br><br>
      Heating the oven at 331F, or medium heat for any other form of oven, will be where this dish is cooked. The filling is to 
      be mixed in a small bowl that has a fork for whisking along. <u>Plant Milks</u> are to be used in these dishes, it is up to you 
      which one fits your needs. <br><br>
      Beginning with what vegetables go inside, we start with sprinkling some <u>Frozen Spinach Bits</u> in our bowl. The goal here is to 
      make this dish feel and be real food available, in a lighter form for sensitivities. <u>Peas</u> in a small amount and <u>Corn</u> are 
      then added from preserves, cans, or the freezer, into your mixing bowl. From there, we sprinkle some <u>Potato Flakes</u>, making certain 
      they are free of butter or milk, when purchased at the store. Potato Flakes are used for making mashed potatoes much of the time. A little 
      bit of <u>Potato Starch</u> is then added, with <u>Tumeric Spice</u> in a dashing amount. A <u>Generic Season All</u> will be the salt 
      and pepper for this dish, with a sprinkle of <u>Nutritional Yeast</u>. Pouring your amount of Plant Milk is then the next step, to make 
      it the gravy mixture that is needed. <u>Gnocchi</u> or <u>Potato Pieces</u> can also be added into the mixture. When whisking the mixture 
      with a fork, add in <u>Corn Starch</u> as needed for your desired thickness, remembering that you will put the dish to bake in the oven, so 
      the mixture will thicken in there. We will place the baking dish in the oven to toughen the mix before adding bread dough on top. But, first 
      make certain that you have added a spoon or so of <u>Vegetable Oil</u> into your mixture.<br><br>
      Pour the mixture into your baking dish, let it sit in the oven until you see or feel in you that it is time to pour what we will make 
      in the meantime, on top. The Dough goes as the top layer here. In the same bowl, using the remaining mixture as some added flavor, we 
      will add in some <u>Flour</u>, which can also be added into the mixture, if there is still a feeling of liquid needing addressing, but 
      in small amounts for that. For the bread top, we start with some Flour, a dip of <u>Baking Soda</u>, a sprinkle of <u>Yeast</u>, and some 
      spices for flavor, suggesting Sage. Add the amount of <u>Water</u> that is desired so that it is something like a pancake batter, take out 
      your Pie Mix from toughening in the oven, and pour the bread mix on top, smearing it evenly as a rising layer. Bake until the bread looks 
      toasted, and you have yourself a Vegetable Pot Pie.

		<h2>Nickelodeon Soup</h2>
		<p class="recipe">This soup is a cleansing basic for a light detoxing meal. These ingredients are made together to be light on a sensitive 
			stomach while feeling homey enough to click on the telly. Named after the provider for Avatar The Last Airbender, this soup has an orange 
			crystal shine that brightly cascades green notes with basic vegetable cuts. For this soup, it's all in how the vegetables are cut. Thinking 
			of each vegetable as a piece of fabric making a sewn dress to wear, the beauty is in the eating. Each vegetable is meant to be chopped in a 
			way of thinking to make each piece "light" to chew and swallow and digest. The secret in this soup is the ease of recognition of the ingredients. 
			While some may find simple recipes boring, what isn't as commonly known about it is that it actually brings enjoyability to the taste buds for a 
			person to easily be able to recognize what they are eating, just as if they were simply putting in the effort to bite and chew an apple, they 
			are comforted by knowing what is in their mouth.<br><br>
			So in amounts where it is easy for the diner to know what they are putting in their body, for their health, the vegetables to add in the soup are: 
			<u>Onion, Carrots, and Celery.</u> After these are chopped in lightness, we add a satisfactory amount of <u>Cleansing Herbs</u>, a pinch of <u>Sour Kraut</u>,
			a drop of <u>Lemon Juice</u>, <u>Tumeric Powder</u> to orange the base, to <u>Fresh Water</u>. Drop in a dollop to a few golden grams of <u>Olive Oil</u>, we 
			want some spicing that cleanses from <u>Paprika</u> and <u>Cayenne Pepper</u>, and then we spice to taste with some <u>Garlic Powder</u>.
			<br><br>
			Boil this soup, mixing on the stove at medium heat until all parts are boiled to a soft, light, chew, and you have yourself Nickelodeon Soup.
