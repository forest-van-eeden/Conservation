Euler Prime Nodes

Each node nₑ is derived as:

nₑ = \lfloor k \times e \rfloor_{p^-}

Where:
	•	e ≈ 2.71828
	•	k ∈ ℕ (1e, 2e, 3e, …)
	•	\lfloor ⋅ \rfloor_{p^-} means “round down to the nearest prime number less than or equal to that value.”

This ensures:
	•	Prime continuity: Each node resonates only with prime-numbered intervals.
	•	Loss as feedback: Any non-prime residue (the decimal portion or skipped composite) is interpreted as excess frequency, dissipated as “feedback loss” outside the organic hearing range — effectively self-regulating harmony.
