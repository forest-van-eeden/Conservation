Goal for the Interplay Language is that it is a language that the Machines can use to interact with interpreter langauges to interpret the Organic Language.

The Interplayer Needs:
1. looking : tokenizes text into meaning
2. growing : growing tokens together
3. spacing : place for growth to go
4. doing : moves the growth in the space

In looking what is needed is for all parts to be defined for what they are.

What we need to do is we need to make in looking.interplay:
- that it tokenizes text into meaning that's in the Organic Language
