//When moire patterns arise in the atmosphere, from a distance, they are signs of verberation from some 
communication in occurance, often resulting as associated feelings or visions of related or known 
associations with the source of the pattern's meaning.

//Moire patterns may also arise with forms of electrical activity, that may be occurring beyond regular 
streaming. This can manifest as a vision of sorts or sensation of sorts in the body or arround, relating 
to a similar way as it would manifest from that of communication.
